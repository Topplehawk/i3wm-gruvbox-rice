Other backgrounds that looks great witth gruvbox can be found at https://gruvbox-wallpapers.pages.dev

In a short time you should be able to find my wallpaper on the gruvbox wallpapers page which can be found at the link above.

I will update this once it can be found at the gruvbox wallpapers site.

This wallpaper can also be found in the main branch of this repo.

to get the gruvbox theme working in vifm you will need to run 
```
wget -P ~/.config/vifm/colors https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vifm/vifm-colors/master/gruvbox.vifm
```
you will then need to add 
```
:colorscheme gruvbox
```
 in the vifmrc file
